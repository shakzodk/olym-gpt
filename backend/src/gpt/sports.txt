Each touch is worth one point, and each bout is separated into three periods of three minutes (with a one-minute break between periods). The first competitor to reach 15 points - or the athlete in the lead when the third period is completed - is declared the winner.\n', '\n', '\nIn team competition, each member of one team faces each member of the other team once (for a total of nine bouts).

In simple terms, TES measures the routine's technicality (such as jump difficulty and how well-executed each element—jumps, spins, et cetera—is performed) and PCS measures the routine's performance (such as music and choreography). The two parts combined determines the score for the segment (short program, rhythm dance, free skating, or free dance). A skater's final overall score is made up of the two different segment scores.\n", '\n', '\nWhat are the different jumps in figure skating?\n', '\n', '\nSingle, double, triple, and quadruple jumps have been performed in figure skating.

This helped pave the way for snowboarding’s inclusion in the Olympic Winter Games.\n', '\n', '\nOlympic Debut\n', '\n', '\nMen’s and women’s snowboarding made their Olympic debuts at the Nagano Games in 1998 with giant slalom and halfpipe competitions. The discipline proved an instant success and returned to Salt Lake City four years later with parallel giant slalom and halfpipe competitions. In Turin, snowboard cross also made its debut.

Wrestlers score points by executing legal holds, throws, takedowns, manoeuvring the opponent to expose his back to the mat for several seconds or by executing reversals.\n', '\n', '\nReversals involve negating an opponent’s position of advantage from a defensive position and gaining control of the situation.\n', '\n', '\nMoves carry points in accordance to their degree of difficulty and a single move can carry from anywhere between one to five points. High scoring moves, generally arching throws, generally carry the maximum number of points.\n', '\n', '\nCompetitors can also gain points if the opponent causes infractions, for example illegal holds, trying to flee a hold rather than defend it, being too negative or by being too passive. These often result in cautions, and the accumulation of three during a bout automatically results in the offending wrestler getting disqualified.\n', '\n', '\nAt the end of the six-minute period, the total scores are tallied and the wrestler with more points wins. In case of a tie, the wrestler who has scored the maximum number of points from a single move is declared the winner.\n', '\n', '\nThe threshold for a victory by technical fall is a 10-point lead in freestyle, and an 8-point lead in Greco-Roman.

Many centuries later, some of the earliest recorded archery tournaments took place during the Zhou dynasty (1046 - 256 BC) in China. Such events were attended by Chinese nobility. Much later, English writers honoured the longbow for famous contributions to their country’s victories in the battles of Crécy, Agincourt and Poitiers.\n', '\n', '\nIn 1200 BC, the Hittites and Assyrians shot their bows from chariots, becoming fearsome opponents in battle.

Freestyle skiing really began to take off in America during the 1960s, when social change and freedom of expression together with the advances in ski equipment led to the development of new and exciting skiing techniques. Freestyle skiing was affectionately known as ‘hotdogging’. The name seemed to perfectly capture the breathtaking mix of acrobatic tricks, jumps and sheer adrenalin rush of the sport.\n', '\n', '\nGetting Recognition\n', '\n', '\nFreestyle was recognised as a discipline by the International Ski Federation (FIS) in 1979.

The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.\n', '\n', '\nInternational Recognition\n', '\n', '\nCountries such as Great Britain, Australia, Belgium, France and Japan deserve a great deal of credit in the development of the sport, since they participated in international open competitions before the sport was recognized by the International Skating Union.

The top two and bottom two scores are eliminated, and the final three scores are added together and multiplied by the degree of difficulty rating of the dive to achieve the total score for that dive.\n', '\n', '\nThe highest overall combined score at the end is declared the winner.\n', '\n', '\nIt is the same process for synchronised diving, except there are 11 judges: six grading the divers’ execution, and five grading synchronisation.\n', '\n', '\nWhat is the hardest Olympic dive?\n', '\n', '\nThe reverse 4½ somersault in the pike position rated at 4.8 is considered to be the hardest dive routine, but competitors could attempt more difficult dives.\n', '\n', '\nWhy do Olympic divers shower after every dive?\n', '\n', '\nDivers shower or jump in a jacuzzi after they compete in order to keep their muscles warm and reduce the chance of any strains or cramps.\n', '\n', '\nDiving and the Olympics\n', '\n', '\nDiving was included in the Olympic Games for the first time at the Olympic Games St. Louis 1904. The springboard and platform events have been included since the 1908 Olympic Games in London. Since the Stockholm Games in 1912, women have taken part in the diving events.\n', '\n', '\nThe first Olympic competitions differed from those which exist nowadays, notably with respect to the height of the platforms and springboards. The diving programme has been relatively stable since the 1928 Games in Amsterdam: men and women take part in 10-metre high-dive and 3-metre springboard events. In 2000, the Sydney Games witnessed the entrance of synchronised diving on both the springboard and the platform.\n', '\n', '\nThis discipline was first dominated by the USA, with four-time Olympic gold medallist Greg Louganis considered one of the sport’s finest athletes ever.

Naismith, an instructor at the YMCA Training School in Massachusetts.\n', '\n', '\nNaismith sought a suitable indoor game to keep his students fit and warm during the cold New England winters. He formulated 13 rules, most of which still apply today.\n', '\n', '\nIn 1893, the first women’s game was played at the Smith College, in Northampton, Massachusetts, USA.\n', '\n', '\nOriginally, basketball was played with peach baskets, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each score. A hole was then drilled into the bottom of the basket, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long rod. In 1906, the peach baskets were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.\n', '\n', '\nAnother element of the original game was that a soccer ball was initially used before switching to a dedicated brown ball. In the late 1950s Tony Hinkle, searching for an alternative that would be more visible to players and spectators introduced an orange ball which grew to become an icon feature of the game.\n', '\n', '\nWhat are the rules of Basketball\n', '\n', '\nBasketball is played by two opposing teams made up of five players on an indoor court.\n', '\n', '\nTo win the game a team must score more field goals than the other team which is done when a player shoots the ball through the opposition’s basket. Teams have a limited amount of time (24 seconds) to shoot the ball during a given possession. If the time elapses, the team in possession must give up the ball and become the team in defence.\n', '\n', '\nPlayers control the ball with their hands but may only advance the ball by passing or dribbling (bouncing the ball on the floor). If a player stops dribbling, then they can’t resume dribbling. They then must pass the ball or shoot it. A ‘travelling’ violation, resulting in a turnover, is issued if a player runs while holding the ball without dribbling. The ball and ballhandler must remain inside the court during gameplay. If a player steps out of bounds of touches the line with their foot while in possession of the ball, a turnover will be issued.\n', '\n', '\nField goals are worth a different number of points depending on where the goal is shot from. Baskets shot from inside the arc that denotes the three-point line on the rectangular court are worth two points. Baskets \\\\ shot from outside the arc are worth three points.*\n', '\n', '\nOne point can be accumulated through free throws, which are worth a point shot. Free throws are awarded to a team when the opposition team fouls.\n', '\n', '\nIllegal physical contact or obstructions without the intention of winning the ball by a defender when an offensive player is aiming to shoot is regarded as a foul.\n', '\n', '\nDefenders must try and regain possession and can do so by blocking or stealing the ball. However, they can’t intefere with a shot while it is on its downward trajectory into the basket. Another thing for defenders to be aware of is that they can’t stay longer than three seconds inside ‘the paint’ which is a zone directly in front of the basket. The same rule applies to an offensive player. If someone has spent three seconds in the paint, they must most out of the space before they can return.\n', '\n', '\nHow long is a Basketball game?\n', '\n', '\nAn international basketball game is typically made up of 10-minute quarters meaning a game will last 40 minutes. This is different to the NBA where quarters are 12 minutes. Another point of difference is the length and number of timeouts. For the Games, all timeouts are one-minute long and each team gets two timeouts in the first half and then three in second with just one in overtime.\n', '\n', '\nIf the score is tied after four quarters, an overtime period of five minutes is played. The teams continue playing overtime periods until one team wins.\n', '\n', '\nBasketball and the Olympics\n', '\n', '\nBasketball made its first Olympic appearance in 1904 in St Louis as a demonstration sport before the men’s event was formally introduced at the Olympic Games in 1936 in Berlin.\n', '\n', '\nWomen’s basketball was later added to the programme at the 1976 Games in Montreal.\n', '\n', '\nThe United States has historically dominated international basketball, and this was reflected at the Games with the nation winning all the men’s titles up to 1972, the year it was defeated by the Soviet Union at the Munich Games.\n', '\n', '\nIn the women’s event, the Soviets took gold in 1976, 1980 and 1992, before the Americans rose to prominence winning all titles from 1984 to 2020, except in 1992.\n', '\n', '\nIn 1992 at the Barcelona Games, professional players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) were allowed for the first time to represent their national teams.

There are differences in the number of players on each team between the two sports, the size of the field, and in some rules.\n", '\n', '\nSoftball pitchers are also required to throw underhand, and most pitchers throw using the windmill pitch style, where the ball is thrown after rotating in a large circle. In softball, top female pitchers can reach speeds of over 100km/h. That speed fits with the fast-paced nature of the game. Since the bases aren’t as far apart, there is a shorter pitching distance. The game is also shorter in duration to baseball, with only seven innings compared to baseball’s nine.\n', '\n', '\nBy whom, where and when was Baseball/Softball invented?\n', '\n', '\nThe earliest record of the game of "baseball" being played was in Surrey, England, in 1749. The sport made it to the United States by the 1770s, and the first organised professional league—the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players—was founded in 1875. Baseball is considered "America\'s past-time".\n', '\n', '\nSoftball was first imagined as “indoor baseball” in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, by reporter George Hancock after watching someone hit a boxing glove with a broom handle. He went on to publish rules for the game and later took it outside, playing on fields too small for baseball. While the rules remained vague, interest in the game grew, and more than 100 area high school teams were formed by 1892.\n', '\n', '\nIn 1895, firefighters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, played a similar game named “kitten ball” using a ball of yarn wrapped in leather. In 1907, a guide for indoor baseball published by Albert Spalding allowed for game flexibility with two constants: a larger ball than baseball as well as underhand pitching. In 1926, Walter Hakanson proposed unifying the disparate versions of the game into one, under a single name: Softball.\n', '\n', '\nWhat are the rules of Baseball/Softball?\n', '\n', '\nTwo teams of nine players aim to score the most runs by striking a ball and running round a sequence of bases to reach the home plate.\n', '\n', '\nThe teams rotate between batting and fielding, with each session called an inning, and switch when the fielding team gets three opposition players out.\n', '\n', '\nThe pitcher throws the ball from a mound toward the catcher which the batter attempts to hit and get around the bases to the home plate.\n', '\n', '\nSoftball is similar but features 9 or 10 players per team, depending on the style being played. The basic rules are the same.\n', '\n', '\nHow long is a Baseball/Softball game?\n', '\n', '\nA baseball game lasts for nine innings, while softball lasts for seven innings. There are three outs per half-inning (teams rotate batting and fielding each half-inning).

Ling's system focused on the harmonious combination of physical movement and music, which laid the foundation for the development of rhythmic gymnastics.\n", '\n', "\nHowever, it was the Hungarian dancer and gymnast, Emile Jacques-Dalcroze, who first incorporated dance and music into the practice of gymnastics in the early 20th century. Jacques-Dalcroze's approach, known as eurhythmics, used music as a way of expressing and enhancing movement.\n", '\n', '\nWhat are the rules of Rhythmic Gymnastics?\n', '\n', '\nAs with artistic gymnastics, performances in rhythmic gymnastics are given by judges, who assess the performance and award a difficulty (D) score and an execution (E) score, which are combined to give the final score for the routine. The Code of Points is renewed after each Olympics.\n', '\n', '\nThe D score is based on each element of the performance including leaps, jumps and use of apparatus. This difficulty score is unlimited.The E score is based on how well the routine was executed either by the individual or the group. This has a starting value of 10 points. The final number is an average of the middle three scores awarded by the judges.The D and E scores are combined at this stage, giving a final score. Then, any deductions for penalties are taken away. The list of instant deductions is incredibly long and complex in rhythmic gymnastics. Competitors can be penalised for anything from breaking the apparatus, to the time taken, to landing heavily on their feet.\n', '\n', '\nRhythmic Gymnastics and the Olympics\n', '\n', '\nRhythmic gymnastics competition began in the 1940s in the Soviet Union and was recognised by the International Gymnastics Federation in 1961. Although the first world championships for the sport were held in 1964, rhythmic gymnastics did not make its Olympic debut until 1984 when Canadian Lori Fung took the first Olympic title in the discipline. Group rhythmic gymnastics made its debut at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta where Spain was the champion.\n', '\n', '\nBest Rhythmic Gymnasts to watch\n', '\n', '\nEastern European countries have dominated the international rhythmic gymnastics scene. However, no NOC has brought home more than a single gold medal from an Olympics, with the exception of the Russian team which, led by stars like Beijing 2008 and London 2012 champion Evgeniya Kanaeva and Rio 2016 champion Margarita Mamun, has swept 10 out of 17 golds since the sport was included on the Olympic programme in 1984.\n', '\n', '\nAt Tokyo 2020, Israel’s Linoy Ashram surprised the world when she stood on top of the podium in the individual all-around competition, becoming the first female Olympic gold medallist from her country. Sadly, we will not see her again in Paris, as the 23-year-old announced her retirement from competitive rhythmic gymnastics in April 2022.\n', '\n', '\nItalian rising star Sofia Raffaeli is predicted by many to take home a historic Olympic gold medal in rhythmic gymnastics at Paris 2024 after becoming the first Italian to claim the all-around overall title at the World Cup event following her victory in Athens this year.

As it is a highly technical sport, trampolinists are required to have an exceptional sense of balance and absolute precision.\n', '\n', '\nBy whom, where and when was Trampoline invented?\n', '\n', '\nThe first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934 at the University of Iowa. It was initially used to train tumblers and astronauts, and as a training tool to develop and hone acrobatic skills for other sports such as diving, gymnastics and freestyle skiing. People enjoyed the sensation so much, they began to trampoline for sheer fun, and it became popular in its own right.\n', '\n', '\nNissen and Griswold envisaged trampolines being used in a variety of new games, although they never grabbed the public’s imagination. In one, called Spaceball, two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end walls attempted to propel a ball through a middle wall, to hit a target on the other side’s end wall.\n', '\n', '\nWhat are the rules of Trampoline?\n', '\n', '\nTrampoline gymnastics utilises four main categories of score: execution, difficulty, horizontal displacement and time of flight.\n', '\n', '\nWorld-class competitions include two different routines in the qualifying competition that feature 10 judged elements. In the finals, the gymnasts perform one routine which can be the same or different from qualifying.\n', '\n', '\nThe gymnasts also receive an execution score based on how well each element is performed, a time of flight score that calculates the amount of time the gymnast spends in the air and a horizontal displacement score which is based off the gymnast’s ability to stay in the middle of the trampoline.\n', '\n', '\nWhat are the different jumps in Trampoline?\n', '\n', '\nGymnasts perform both forward and backward flipping elements in Olympic trampoline. Several comment elements include a Triffus (triple front somersault with at least a half twist) and a Miller (a double back flip with three twists).\n', '\n', '\nTrampoline and the Olympics\n', '\n', '\nTrampolining made its first appearance at the 2000 Games in Sydney, with men’s and women’s competitions.

This introduces the elements of strategy, bravery and skill needed for racing.\n', '\n', '\nNorth American Origin\n', '\n', '\nShort track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.\n', '\n', '\nInternational Recognition\n', '\n', '\nCountries such as Great Britain, Australia, Belgium, France and Japan deserve a great deal of credit in the development of the sport, since they participated in international open competitions before the sport was recognized by the International Skating Union. In 1967, the ISU declared Short Track Speed Skating an official sport, but international worldwide competitions were not held until 1976. During this period of time, countries kept competing amongst themselves.\n', '\n', '\nOlympic History\n', '\n', '\nAfter having been a demonstration sport at the 1988 Games in Calgary, short track speed skating became part of the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992, with two individual events and two relays.
